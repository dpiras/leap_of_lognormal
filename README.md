# Leap of lognormal: expensive $N$-body simulations from cheap lognormal fields
This repository contains some of the code to reproduce the results in Piras et al., [`"Fast and realistic large-scale structure from machine-learning-augmented random field simulations"`](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220507898P/abstract). In short, we use a deep learning algorithm to map cheap lognormal random fields to more realistic $N$-body simulations. The dataset of highly-correlated pairs of cheap and expensive simulations is obtained from the [Quijote simulation suite](https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 



Feel free to contact Davide Piras at dr.davide.piras@gmail.com, or [raise an issue here](https://github.com/dpiras/leap_of_lognormal/issues), in case you want to access training data or need help with the code.
