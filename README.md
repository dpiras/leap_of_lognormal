# Leap of lognormal: The code will be pushed here once the paper is accepted - stay tuned!
This repository contains some of the code to reproduce the results in Piras et al., Fast and realistic large-scale structure from machine-learning-augmented random field simulations


Feel free to contact Davide Piras at dr.davide.piras@gmail.com in case you want to access the code or the data earlier.
